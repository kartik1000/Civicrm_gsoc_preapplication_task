# Civicrm_gsoc_preapplication_task
This Repository contains the necessary screenshots and extension code which must be included as part of GSoC Pre Application Task. <br>
My Hello World Extension is named as com.example.hellocivicrm built using civix. In the Extension I tried to create a Basic Web Page around a Form For users to select their favourite CiviCRM Extension. I tried creating a form, entities, case-type, custom fields,report and unit-test class using civix only.
